\section{Introduction}

This report looks at \cite{trop} project use casees and to determine the project
requirements, and then evaluates where the concepts, components and services
from the IVOA can be applied to meet some of the \cite{trop} project requirements.

\section{The IVOA Virtual Observatory}

The \citetitle*{ivoa} (\cite{ivoa}) was formed in June 2002 with a mission to
\begin{quote}
"facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory."
\end{quote}

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is the realization of the \cite{ivoa} vision of
an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The work of the IVOA focuses on the development of standards, providing a forum
for members to debate and agree the technical standards that are needed to make
the VO possible.

The operational VO itself is comprised of a global shared metadata registry,
the Registry, and a number of individual data discovery and data access services
deployed at each of the participating institutes.
These components work together to present a uniform mechanism for discovering
and accessing data, irrespective of where it is physically located.

The VO architecture and data discovery processes are very similar to the
interconnected metadata collections approach described in
\citetitle{jones-2006} (\cite{jones-2006}).

\begin{quote}
".... a loosely structured collection of project-specific data sets
accompanied by structured metadata about each of the data sets."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"Each of the data sets is stored in a manner that is opaque to the data system in
that the data themselves cannot be directly queried; rather, the structured
metadata describing the data is queried in order to locate data sets of
interest."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"After data sets of interest are located, more detailed information
.... can be extracted from the metadata and used to load, query, and
manipulate individual data sets."
\end{quote}

\subsection{Example use case}

A useful way to illustrate how the data discovery process works in the VO
is to look at an example task such as selecting images covering a particular
region of the sky, in a particular wavelength e.g. infrared, visible light,
radio or xray.

\subsubsection{Service discovery}

The first step of the process is to identify the services that provide access to
the type of data we are looking for by querying the \cite{ivoa.reg}.

The \cite{ivoa.reg} is comprised of a number of small local registry services,
typically hosted at the participating institute level, working in cooperation
with a set of higer level global registry services hosted by a few key institutes
that aggregate the data from the smaller registries to create a global searchable
index of metadata describing all of the services and datasets available in
the VO.

When a new service is deployed, part of the deployment process involves
registering the service with the local registry. The local registry is then
responsible for collecting and storing the metadata that describes both the
service itself and the datasets that it provides access to.

Once the metadata for a serviceor dataset has been registered in a local registry,
it is automatically propagated up to the next level and replicated between the
global registries.

This makes it possible to access the metadata for all of the services and datasets
published in the VO by querying any one of the global registries.

The first step in fulfilling our example use case is to identify services that
contain the type of data we are looking for, in this case images, by querying
the \cite{ivoa.reg} for services that support the \citetitle*{ivoa.sia}
(\cite{ivoa.sia}) capability.

In addition to the technical details of services and their capabilities the
\cite{ivoa.reg} also contains details about the content of datasets, including
details of the wavelength(s) measured, e.g. infrared, visible, radio or xray.

This allows us to refine our query to search for \cite{ivoa.sia} services that
contain images in a specific waveband, e.g. optical, infrared or x-ray.

The \cite{ivoa.reg} query returns a table of data, each row of which contains
information about a \cite{ivoa.sia} service that provides the type of data we are
interested in - images in a particular wavelength.


The VO is itself an evolving system, building on the existing work to add
additional levels of integration as new features are added to the IVOA
specifications.

A recent addition to the list of \cite{ivoa} standards is the
\citetitle*{ivoa.moc} (\cite{ivoa.moc})
which allows \cite{ivoa.reg} services to perform coarse grained region matches.

This will enable us to further refine our \cite{ivoa.reg} query to filter for
\cite{ivoa.sia} services that contained data in a particular
region of the sky.

\subsubsection{Data discovery}

The next stage of the process is to query each of the \cite{ivoa.sia} services
in the list to discover details about the individual images available from that
service.

\noindent
A \cite{ivoa.sia} service can handle queries that specifiy a particular wavelength
and a particular region of the sky :
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{POS}  The positional region (ra, dec)
  \item \texttt{BAND} The energy interval (wavelength)
\end{itemize}

Each \cite{ivoa.sia} service returns a table of data, each row of which
contains metadata about an individual image. The details of the fields in the
image metadata are defined in the
\citetitle*{ivoa.obscore} (\cite{ivoa.obscore})
data model.

This demonstrates a core part of the \cite{ivoa} architecture, interoperable services
based on standard interfaces and data formats.

All of the \cite{ivoa.sia} services will return a standard response, which makes
it much easier to combine them to produce a global list of all the images available
within the whole VO that match our search criteria.

\noindent
The two key components of this are :
\begin{itemize}
\item A standard interface for the global \cite{ivoa.reg} that uses a standard
set of attributes to describe datasets and services
\item A standard interface for local \cite{ivoa.sia} data access services that
uses a standard set of attributes to describe the available data products
\end{itemize}

The separation between the initial service discovery query at the global
level followed by individual data discovery queries at the local level
is very similar to the stages described in \cite{jones-2006} :
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Querying the metadata to establish the location of suitable data
  \item Querying the individual services to establish what the data is and how to access it
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tropical forest science}

\subsection{Carbon density comparison}

We can compare the VO data discovery process for astronomy data with an example
use case based on a recent study
\citetitle*{mitchard-2014} (\cite{mitchard-2014}),
comparing remote sensing data from satellites with ground plot data collected
in the field.

The study compares two sets of remote sensing data, from
\citetitle*{nasa-jpl-carbon} (\cite{nasa-jpl-carbon})
\citetitle{saatchi-2011} (\cite{saatchi-2011}) [RS1]
and the
\citetitle*{whrc} (\cite{whrc})
\citetitle{baccini-2012} (\cite{baccini-2012}) [RS2]
with four sets of ground plot data from

\begin{itemize}
\item\citetitle*{rainfor} (\cite{rainfor}) (\cite{peacock-2007}) (\cite{malhi-2009})
\item\citetitle*{atdn} (\cite{atdn})
\item\citetitle*{team} (\cite{team})
\item\citetitle*{ppbio} (\cite{ppbio}) (\cite{pezzini-2012})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Remote sensing source data}

It is not know what data discovery and data access methods were used to
identify and access the primary remote sensing source data.

However, there are a number of data discovery tools available that enable
researchers to search for remote sensing data products such as satellite
images and radar scans.

A good examples of this type of tool are the
\cite{usgs-explorer}
and
\cite{usgs-glovis}
tools provided by the
\citetitle*{usgs} (\cite{usgs})
    
\begin{quote}
"The USGS EarthExplorer ... provides users the ability to query, search,
and order satellite images, aerial photographs, and cartographic products from
several sources"
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"In addition to data from the Landsat missions and a variety of other data providers,
EE now provides access to MODIS land data products from the NASA Terra and Aqua missions,
and ASTER level-1B data products over the U.S. and Territories from the NASA ASTER mission"
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"The USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) is an online search and order tool for
selected satellite data. The viewer allows access to all available browse images
from the Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 4/5 TM, Landsat 1-5 MSS, EO-1 ALI, EO-1 Hyperion,
MRLC, and Tri-Decadal data sets, as well as Aster TIR, Aster VNIR and MODIS browse
images from the DAAC inventory"
\end{quote}

The \cite{usgs} also provides large area composited mosaics generated from
\cite{landsat}
data via the
\cite{weld}
project.

\begin{quote}
"The WELD data products are processed so users do not need to apply the equations,
spectral calibration coefficients, and solar information, needed to convert Landsat
digital numbers to reflectance and brightness temperature.
They are defined in the same coordinate system and align precisely, making them simple
to use for multi-temporal applications.
The products provide consistent data that can be used to derive higher-level land
cover as well as geo-physical and biophysical products for assessment of surface
dynamics and to study Earth system functioning"
\end{quote}

The \cite{usgs} also maintains a
\citetitle*{usgs-lta} (\cite{usgs-lta})
of historical remote sensing data.

\begin{quote}
"The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Long Term Archive (LTA) at the National Center
for Earth Resource Observations and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, SD is one of
the largest civilian remote sensing data archives"
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"Time series images are a valuable resource for scientists, disaster managers,
engineers, educators, and the general public. USGS EROS has archived, managed,
and preserved land remote sensing data for more than 35 years and is a leader
in preserving land remote sensing imagery"
\end{quote}

However, all of these interfaces are based around human interaction.
There are no machine readable data discovery services for this type of remote sensing data.

\subsubsection{Carbon density maps}

A detailed description of the [RS1] dataset produced by \citetitle*{nasa-jpl-carbon}
is available in the authors paper (\cite{saatchi-2011}).

The paper, along with the additional supporting information available on the
\cite{pnas} website, describes the main upstream data sources and the methods applied.

However, details of the data sources, the instruments, target areas and date ranges
the data covers are not available in a machine readable format.

\begin{quote}
"Ground data used to train the biomass prediction model were
derived from various sources including published literature
and national forest inventories collected by the authors
and their colleagues."
\end{quote}

The carbon density dataset itself is available as \cite{format-geotiff} files,
with associated \cite{format-world} metadata, for download from the
\cite{nasa-jpl-carbon-ftp} site.

A detailed description of the [RS2] dataset produced by the \citetitle*{whrc}
is available in the authors paper (\cite{baccini-2012}).

The paper, along with the additional supporting information available from
the \cite{journal-nature} website,
describes the upstream data sources and the methods applied.
However, details of the data sources, the instruments, target areas and date ranges
the data covers are not available in a machine readable format.

The carbon density dataset itself is available by request from the 
\cite{whrc-data} website.
Access to the data requires filling in a simple web form declaring
who you are and what you want to use the data for.
On submitting the web-form, an automated email reply is generated
containing a URL to a \cite{format-zip}
file on the WHRC website.

The \cite{format-zip} file contains the data as \cite{format-geotiff}
files, with associated \cite{format-world} metadata.

\subsubsection{Ground plot data}

The four sets of ground plot data from
\cite{rainfor}, \cite{atdn}, \cite{team}
and \cite{ppbio}
were combined together in the 
\cite{forest-plots}
database.

Details of the design and capabilities of the \cite{forest-plots}
system is presented in \citetitle*{gonzalez-2011} (\cite{gonzalez-2011}).

\begin{quote}
"The ForestPlots.net web application was designed primarily
as a repository for long-term intact tropical forest inventory
plots, where trees within an area are individually identified,
measured and tracked through time"
\end{quote}

Of the three sets of ground plot data, the data from \cite{rainfor} and
\cite{atdn} were already available in the \cite{forest-plots} database.

The plot data from the \cite{team} and \cite{ppbio} projects were
downloaded and imported into the \cite{forest-plots} database manually.

A permanent archive of the combiuned field plot data
is stored in the \cite{forest-plots} database
as a publically available dataset\footnote{\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.5521/FORESTPLOTS.NET/2014_1}}
and is available in the supporting information for the paper. 

\subsubsection{\cite{term-agb} data}

The \cite{term-agb} data for the forest plots were calculated
using a \cite{comp-lang-sql} query provided by the \cite{forest-plots}
system which implements the tropical forest model described in
\citetitle*{chave-2005} (\cite{chave-2005}).
The results of the \cite{term-agb} calculation for each
forest plot are included in the combined field plot dataset
stored in the \cite{forest-plots} database.

The paper refers to a number of maps derived from the field plot data
and other sources which were generated as part of the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{kriged} map of mean wood density ($\rho$)
\item Ratio of diameter (D) to tree height (H) \cite{feldpausch-2012}
\item \cite{kriged} map of basal area
\item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D and species-specific $\rho$, and a regional height model (K\textsubscript{DH$\rho$})
\item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D and species-specific $\rho$, but a pan Amazonian height model (K\textsubscript{D$\rho$})
\item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D, regional height models and $\rho$, but with $\rho$ fixed at 0.63 (K\textsubscript{DH})
\item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D, pan-Amazonian height model, and $\rho$ fixed at 0.63 (K\textsubscript{D})
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{term-agb} map from [RS1] (\cite{saatchi-2011})
\item \cite{term-agb} map from [RS2] (\cite{baccini-2012})
\item Difference between [RS1] and K\textsubscript{DH$\rho$}
\item Difference between [RS2] and K\textsubscript{DH$\rho$}
\item Difference between [RS1] and [RS2]
\end{itemize}

These derived datasets and maps are not available in the supporting information for the paper.

The \cite{term-agb} data derived from two remote-sensing-derived maps,
\cite{saatchi-2011} [RS1] and \cite{baccini-2012} [RS2]
are not available in the supporting information for the paper.

\section{Data discovery requirements}

Based on the \cite{trop} use cases we have studied so far it is clear that data discovery
forms a significant part of the requirements for \cite{trop}.

In the many of the use cases a significant part of the source material for the use case has come
from outside the \cite{trop} community.

For example, both the [RS1] (\cite{saatchi-2011}) and [RS2] (\cite{baccini-2012}) datasets used in
the \cite{mitchard-2014} use case came from external data sources, \citetitle*{nasa-jpl-carbon}
and \citetitle*{whrc} respectively.

In the long term, the ideal solution would be to encourage these external data providers to join
the \cite{trop} community and publish and curate their own data using the \cite{trop}
system.

In the short term, in order to make this type of external data available as part of the \cite{trop}
data discovery process, it will necessary for a member of the \cite{trop} community to register
and curate the metadata about the external data in the \cite{trop} system.

A number of the \cite{trop} use cases also require data created or provided by members of the
\cite{trop} community.

This means that the \cite{trop} needs to provide support for individual members of the
\cite{trop} community to publish indivudual datasets within the \cite{trop} system.
Enabling other members of the \cite{trop} community to discover and use the data as
source material for their own research.
Promoting the sharing and re-use of results within the \cite{trop} community.

In both cases, the requirements for the data discovery process are that the users is able to specify
an area of interest and the type of data they are interested in and then gradually narrows the search
criteria in response to the data discovery results until they find the data they are interested in.

Based on this outline we can begin to evaluate how well the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software
meets the \cite{trop} requirements and compare this with equivalent \cite{gis} software
currently available.

At first glance, the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{trop} data discovery processes are very similar.
Suggesting that the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software should be a good fit for the \cite{trop}
requirements.

However, there are a number of issues that may mean that the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software
are not the most best solution for meeting the \cite{trop} requirements.

One issue is that a significant part of the \cite{ivoa} metadata structure relies on a number of
domain specific astronomy terms and concepts, making it difficult to apply the \cite{ivoa}
metadata structure to data from a different domain.

Although it would be possible to remove the domain specific terms and concepts from
the \cite{ivoa} data model and replace them with a set of terms that were more suited to the
\cite{trop} domain.
Doing this piece at a time, gradually evolving a new metadata data model for the
\cite{trop} project would be a non-trivial undertaking involving a significant
comitment of time and resources.
It is worth bearing in mind that the \cite{ivoa} \cite{ivoa.obscore} data model
that forms the basis of a lot of the \cite{ivoa} data discovery process
is the result of 10 years work by the \cite{ivoa} working groups
to define a common data model for astronomy observations.

With this in mind, it would probably be more practical to base the \cite{trop} metadata
data model on a existing data model(s) that has been developed for domains similar to
\cite{trop}.

Two examples of this are the \citetitle*{format-world} and \citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml})
metadata formats.

The \citetitle*{format-world} format provides a simple way of annotating an existing map
or raster image with GIS location metadata.

The \cite{format-world} format consists of a plain text file format containing details of
the location, scale and rotation of a map or raster image.

Both of the remote sensing datasets
[RS1] (\cite{saatchi-2011})
and
[RS2] (\cite{baccini-2012})
provide
\cite{format-world}
metadata 
using the \textit{example.tfw} convention to associate the metadata
with the \cite{format-geotiff} maps.

\citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml}) is a metadata specification for describing ecological datasets,
based on work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated efforts
\citetitle*{michener-1997} (\cite{michener-1997}).

\cite{eml} is implemented as a series of \cite{format-xml} document types that can be
used to describe different aspects of an ecological dataset.

A second issue with the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} metadata \cite{ivoa.reg} and
data discovery tools concerns the allocation of roles and responsibilities for
managing the metadata within the \cite{ivoa.reg}, and the way these reflect the
structure of the \cite{ivoa} and its members involved in the development process.

Historically, the most active contributors to the development of the \cite{ivoa}
standards and the \cite{astro} software have been primary data providers within
the astronomy community.

Many of these represent large scale data providers responsible for publishing and
curating the primary science archive for a telescope survey or satelite mission.

In the \cite{trop} domain these are equivalent to the upstream data providers who publish
and curate the original satelite remote sensing data, such as the \citetitle{landsat}
data archive or the \citetitle{usgs-lta} provided by the \cite{usgs}.

This has influenced the way that the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software has
been developed. In particular, the initial emphasis on providing the tools and
services for publishing large datasets, meant that the curation of the dataset
metadata was seen as a system administrator role, responsible for curating all of
the metadata published by that institute.

As a result, many of the current user interface tools for managing and curating data sets
are designed around a single system administrator managing the metadata for an entire
service, rather that individual researchers managing the metadata for their own data.

In contrast, in the \cite{trop} use cases a significan portion of the data in the system
will be provided by and curated by individual researchers or small research groups.
For example, the results and supplementary data for the \cite{mitchard-2014} paper would
be published and curated by the members of the research team themselves.

Neither of these issues are 'show stoppers', it should be possible to replace the \cite{ivoa}
\cite{ivoa.obscore} with a new datamodel designed for \cite{trop}, and it would also be possible
to develop a new user interface and permission infrastructure to enable individual users
to publish and curate their own data.

However, bearing in mind the level of resources these changes would require it would be useful
to compare the data discovery capabilities and features provided by the \cite{ivoa} and
\cite{astro} software with the data discovery capabilities of some of the current \cite{gis}
based systems specifically designed to handle geographical and ecological data.

\subsubsection{Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases}

The \citetitle*{givd} (\cite{givd}) system is a complex registry of metadata describing
databases of vegetation plot data from around the world.

The \cite{givd} system contains records for
\textit{ ... 209 databases with 3,148,605 vegetation plots},
including three of the datasets from our use cases.

\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{forest-plots} \texttt{[GIVD:00-00-001]}\footnote{\url{http://www.givd.info/ID/00-00-001}}
\item \cite{ppbio} \texttt{[GIVD:SA-BR-001]}\footnote{\url{http://www.givd.info/ID/SA-BR-001}}
\item \cite{team}  \texttt{[GIVD:00-00-002]}\footnote{\url{http://www.givd.info/ID/00-00-002}}.
\end{itemize}

In \citetitle*{dengler-2011} (\cite{dengler-2011}) the \cite{givd} project team describe the system
architecture and outline plans to aggregate different types of data from external sources.

\begin{quote}
"Our longer-term vision is to develop GIVD in ways similar to Metacat (Jones et
al. 2006), so that, ultimately, users who query GIVD will not only receive
information on which databases contain data suitable for the intended analyses,
but they will also discover other data from distributed databases, with GIVD
acting as the central node."
\end{quote}

This is broadly similar to the VO architecture of distributed datasets
the interconnected metadata collections approach described in
\citetitle{jones-2006} (\cite{jones-2006}).

However, the emphasis is on providing a human interactive search facility
with the \cite{givd} system acting as the central node.
The current published plans do not include providing a machine readable
interface to enable \cite{givd} system itself to be used as a component in
in a larger distributed system.

\subsubsection{\cite{ppbio} Information System}

In \citetitle*{pezzini-2012} (\cite{pezzini-2012}) 
the \cite{ppbio} team describe the role of the data manager and the metadata
collection processes developed as part of the \cite{ppbio} Information System.

They also describe the transition from an initial flat file data storage system,
to a new system based on \cite{metacat}.

\begin{quote}
"To facilitate data searches, all the metadata were converted to XML,
and the PPBio has installed a METACAT server to integrate with the
Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), a network which aims to
assist ecological and environmental research."
\end{quote}

This indicates a move towards using open standards for the
metadata and the service interfaces, enabling the
\cite{ppbio} Information System
to become part of a larger distrbuted system.

\subsubsection{\citetitle*{knb}}

The \citetitle*{knb} {\cite{knb}} is a data repository
\begin{quote}
"intended to facilitate ecological and environmental research"
\end{quote}
by enabling researchers to
\begin{quote}
"share, discover, access and interpret complex ecological data"
\end{quote}

The \cite{knb} system uses the \cite{metacat} software to store and query
the \citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml}) metadata for each of the datasets in the repository.

In some cases the \cite{knb} system stores both the metadata and actual
data itself, e.g.
\citetitle*{dietze-2004}\footnote{\url{https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/AA/mdietze.3.2}}.

In other cases the \cite{knb} system only stores the metadata,
referring to data that is stored elsewhere, e.g.
\citetitle*{dietze-2004}\footnote{\url{https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/AA/mdietze.3.2}}.


\subsubsection{\cite{metacat}}

\cite{metacat} is an open source data management tool that provides a
repository for managing both data and metadata in a single system.

\begin{quote}
Metacat is a repository for data and metadata (documentation about data) that
helps scientists find, understand and effectively use data sets they manage or
that have been created by others.
\end{quote}

Metacat is capable of handling a variety of different metadata formats,
including
\citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml})


%%endnote{https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/biometadata}

\subsubsection{DataONE}

The Metacat project is itself part of the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE)
%%endnote{https://www.dataone.org/}
project, a collaboration spconsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation to build
an infrastructire from distributed webservices that provides open, persistent, robust,
and secure access to Earth observational data.
 
\begin{quote}
The DataONE project is a collaboration among scientists, technologists,
librarians, and social scientists to build a robust, interoperable, and
sustainable system for preserving and accessing Earth observational data at
national and global scales. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation,
DataONE partners focus on technological, financial, and organizational
sustainability approaches to building a distributed network of data repositories
that are fully interoperable, even when those repositories use divergent
underlying software and support different data and metadata content standards.
\end{quote}

The DataONE arcitecture is based on a set of top level 
\textit{Coordinating Nodes}
and
\textit{Member Nodes}
located at each participating institute or organisation

\textit{Coordinating Nodes}
provide a replicated catalog of Member Node holdings, enabling
scientists to discover data wherever they reside,
and data repositories to make their data and services available
to the international community.

The individual \textit{Member Nodes}
at each institute enable them to make their data available
to the rest of the DataONE network
via a standard webservice interface.

Again, this two layers of data discovery and data access
is similar the virtual observatory architecture.


\subsubsection{\citetitle*{fgdc-geo}}

http://ckan.org/features/
\begin{quote}
"Many organisations already have their data in repositories with well-defined process and procedures
for publishing and managing data. In this case the data can be simply pulled regularly into CKAN
from the existing repositories. To facilitate this model we’ve developed a sophisticated and
customisable “harvesting” mechanism which can fetch and import records from many different
repository sources, including:
\end{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item Geospatial CSW Servers (see geospatial for more information)
\item Existing web catalogues
\item Simple HTML index pages or Web Accessible Folders
\item ArcGIS, Geoportal Servers and Z39.50 databases
\item Other CKAN instances
\end{itemize}
\begin{quote}
This functionality is used on data.gov to get data in from hundreds of their agencies,
on data.gov.uk to implement a Discovery Metadata Service used to fulfill the UK’s
obligations under the EU INSPIRE directive."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Because the harvesting functionality can be used to pull in metadata from other CKAN instances,
it can also be used to create a federated network of CKAN nodes which share data between each other.
This is useful if, for example, a national portal wanted to aggregate information from local
government CKAN instances, or if a topic-specific CKAN instance was created which aggregated
a subset of datasets from other CKAN sources. CKAN follows the DCAT standard for data catalogue
metadata, so data can also be federated from other non-CKAN catalogues."
