\section{Introduction}

Two key objectives of the ASTROTROP project are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate the potential to use or adapt the AstroGrid and later VO
    software to create an operational virtual pan-tropical forest observatory.
    \item Demonstrate the feasibility of key functions of a pan-tropical
    forest observatory.
\end{itemize}

As a step towards addressing these objectives, and in particular to
evaluate what is feasible and what is not, we have drawn on the knowledge
and experience gained from development of the \cite{astro} and \cite{ivoa}
virtual observatory systems to explore these objectives and to answer the
following related questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What would be required to implement a virtual observatory system
    for the TROPGLOBE research community, capable of supporting the science
    use-cases outlined on the \cite{atrop} website.
    \item What components from the \cite{astro} and \cite{ivoa} projects
    would be appropriate to use in developing a virtual observatory system
    for the TROPGLOBE research community.
\end{itemize}

\section{The IVOA Virtual Observatory}

The \citetitle*{ivoa} (\cite{ivoa}) was formed in June 2002 with a mission to:
\begin{quote}
``facilitate the international coordination and collaboration necessary for
the development and deployment of the tools, systems and organizational
structures necessary to enable the international utilization of astronomical
archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory."
\end{quote}

The \citetitle*{vo} (\cite{vo}) is the realization of the \cite{ivoa} vision
of an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The work of the \cite{ivoa} focuses on the development of standards,
providing a forum for members to debate and agree the technical standards
that are needed to make the \cite{vo} possible.

The operational \cite{vo} itself is comprised of a global shared metadata
registry, the \cite{ivoa-reg}, and a number of individual data discovery
and data access services deployed at each of the participating institutes.
These components work together to present a uniform mechanism for discovering
and accessing data, irrespective of where it is physically located.

The \cite{vo} architecture and data discovery processes are very similar to
the \textit{'interconnected metadata collections'} approach to bioinformatics
described in \citetitle{jones-2006} (\cite{jones-2006}):
\begin{quote}
``.... a loosely structured collection of project-specific data sets
accompanied by structured metadata about each of the data sets."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``Each of the data sets is stored in a manner that is opaque to the data
system in that the data themselves cannot be directly queried; rather,
the structured metadata describing the data is queried in order to locate
data sets of interest."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``After data sets of interest are located, more detailed information .... can
be extracted from the metadata and used to load, query, and manipulate
individual data sets."
\end{quote}

\subsection{Example use case}

A useful way to illustrate how the data discovery process works in the VO
is to look at an example task such as selecting images covering a particular
region of the sky, in a particular wavelength range e.g. infrared, visible light,
radio or x-ray.

The query may come direct from a user explicitly querying the service, or the
may be generated by an application searching for suitable type of data for it
to process.  

\subsubsection{Service discovery}

The first step of the process is to identify the services that provide
access to the type of data we are looking for by querying the \cite{ivoa-reg}.

The \cite{ivoa-reg} is comprised of a number of small local registry
services, typically hosted at the participating institute level, working in
cooperation with a set of higher level global registry services hosted by a
few key institutes that aggregate the data from the smaller registries to
create a global searchable index of metadata describing all of the services
and datasets available in the \cite{vo}.

When a new service is deployed, part of the deployment process involves
registering the service with the local registry.
The local registry is then responsible for collecting and storing the
metadata that describes both the service itself and the datasets that it
provides access to.
Once the metadata for a service or dataset has been registered in a local
registry, it is automatically propagated up to the next level and replicated
between the global registries.

This makes it possible to access the metadata for all of the services
and datasets published in the \cite{vo} by querying one of the global
registries.

The first step in fulfilling our example use case is to identify services that
contain the type of data we are looking for, in this case images, by querying
the \cite{ivoa-reg} for services that support the \citetitle*{ivoa-sia}
(\cite{ivoa-sia}) capability.

In addition to the technical details of services and their capabilities
the \cite{ivoa-reg} also contains details about the content of datasets,
including details of the wavelength(s) measured, e.g. infrared, visible,
radio or x-ray.

This allows us to refine our query to search for \cite{ivoa-sia} services
that contain images in a specific waveband, e.g. optical, infrared or x-ray.

The \cite{ivoa-reg} query returns a table of data, each row of which contains
information about a \cite{ivoa-sia} service that provides the type of data
we are interested in - images in a particular wavelength.

The \cite{vo} is itself an evolving system, building on the existing work
to add additional levels of integration as new features are added to the
IVOA specifications.

A recent addition to the list of \cite{ivoa} standards is the
\citetitle*{ivoa-moc} (\cite{ivoa-moc}) which allows \cite{ivoa-reg}
services to perform coarse grained region matches.

This will enable us to further refine our \cite{ivoa-reg} query to filter
for \cite{ivoa-sia} services that contained data in a particular region of
the sky.

\subsubsection{Data discovery}

The next stage of the process is to query each of the \cite{ivoa-sia}
services in the list to discover details about the individual images
available from that service.

\noindent
An \cite{ivoa-sia} service can handle queries that specifiy a particular
wavelength and a particular region of the sky:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{POS}  The positional region (ra, dec).
  \item \texttt{BAND} The energy interval (wavelength).
\end{itemize}

In the context of this example, a positional point in the sky identified
by the right ascension (ra) and declination (dec) polar coordinates are
broadly analogous to the terrestrial latitude and longitude coordinate system.

Each \cite{ivoa-sia} service returns a table of data, each row of which
contains metadata about an individual image. The details of the fields
in the image metadata are defined in the \citetitle*{ivoa-obscore}
(\cite{ivoa-obscore}) data model.

This demonstrates a core part of the \cite{ivoa} architecture, interoperable
services based on standard interfaces and data formats.

All of the \cite{ivoa-sia} services will return a standard response, which
makes it much easier to combine them to produce a global list of all the
images available within the whole VO that match our search criteria.

\noindent
The two key components of this are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A standard interface for the global \cite{ivoa-reg} that uses a
    standard set of attributes to describe datasets and services.
    \item A standard interface for local \cite{ivoa-sia} data access services
    that uses a standard set of attributes to describe the available data
    products.
\end{itemize}

The separation between the initial service discovery query at the global
level followed by individual data discovery queries at the local level is
very similar to the stages described in \cite{jones-2006}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Querying the metadata to establish the location of suitable data.
  \item Querying the individual services to establish what the data is and
  how to access it.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tropical forest science}

\subsection{Carbon Density Comparison}

We can compare the \cite{vo} data discovery process for astronomy data with
an example use case based on a recent study
(\cite{mitchard-2014})
which compares two maps based on satellite remote sensing data
(\cite{saatchi-2011}; \cite{baccini-2012}),
with four studies based of ground plot data from
\citetitle*{rainfor} (\cite{rainfor}) (\cite{peacock-2007}; \cite{malhi-2009})
the
\citetitle*{atdn} (\cite{atdn});
\citetitle*{team} (\cite{team});
and the
\citetitle*{ppbio} (\cite{ppbio}) (\cite{pezzini-2012})

\subsubsection{Remote sensing source data}

The paper does not give details of the data discovery and data access methods
used to access the primary remote sensing source data. However, there are a
number of data discovery tools available that enable researchers to search
for forest area maps resulting from the processing of remote sensing data
products such as satellite or radar images.
Because the sharing of such digial maps is still relatively new, these search
procedures have been custom-designed for individual sources. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Terra-i system, hosted by the International Center for
    Tropical Agriculture, the CGIAR Programme on Forestry, Trees and
    Agroforestry, the Nature Conservancy, the School of Business and
    Engineering (Vaud), and King’s College London, uses 250 m resolution
    MODIS 16 day mosaics. Registered users of the Terra-i website
    (http://www.terra-i.org) select the 10 degree x 10 degree "tile" for
    which they require data. They are then able to download maps showing
    various types of change between specified years since 2004 in RASTER ARC
    ASCII format at 250 m resolution. Registered and unregistered users can
    also use visualization software on the website to examine the spatial
    data and to calculate rates of change by country, ecoregion, protected
    area or for areas that the user defines on the map.

    \item The Global Forest Change system, managed by the
    University of Maryland but hosted by Google Earth Engine
    (http://earthenginepartners. appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest),
    provides access to maps of global forest cover change between 2000
    and 2013, derived from 30 m resolution Landsat images. The dataset
    is also divided into 10 degree x 10 degree "tiles" for downloads in
    .TIF format. The maps may also be analysed online using visualization
    software on Google Earth Engine.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Carbon density maps}

A detailed description of the dataset produced by \citetitle*{nasa-jpl-carbon}
(\cite{nasa-jpl-carbon}) is available in the associated paper
(\cite{saatchi-2011}).

The paper, along with the additional supporting information available
on the \citetitle*{pnas} (\cite{pnas}) website,
provide a textual description
of the primary data sources
and the analysis methods that were applied.

However, technical details of the data sources, instruments, target areas
and date ranges the data covers are not available in a
\cite{machine-readable}
format.

The carbon density dataset itself is available as \cite{format-geotiff}
files, with associated \cite{format-world} metadata, for download from the
\cite{nasa-jpl-carbon-ftp} site.

A detailed description of the dataset produced by the \citetitle*{whrc}
(\cite{whrc}) is available in the associated paper (\cite{baccini-2012}).

The paper, along with the additional supporting information available from
the \cite{journal-nature} website,
provide a textual description
of the primary data sources
and the analysis methods that were applied.

However, technical details of the data sources, instruments, target areas
and date ranges the data covers are not available in a
\cite{machine-readable}
format.

The carbon density dataset itself is available by request from the
\cite{whrc-data} website. Access to the data requires filling in a simple
web form declaring who you are and what you want to use the data for. On
submitting the webform, an automated email reply is generated containing
a URL to a \cite{format-zip} file on the \cite{whrc} website.

The \cite{format-zip} file referred to in the email contains the data as
\cite{format-geotiff} files, with associated \cite{format-world} metadata.

This is a fairly standard mechanism for providing access to research
data. However, it may not be sufficient to support the complex data
classification and indexing needed to support an integrated
\cite{vo} system.

\subsubsection{Ground plot data}

The four sets of ground plot data from \cite{rainfor}, \cite{atdn},
\cite{team} and \cite{ppbio} were combined together in the \cite{forest-plots}
database.

Details of the design and capabilities of the \cite{forest-plots} system
is presented in \citetitle*{gonzalez-2011} (\cite{gonzalez-2011}).

\begin{quote}
``The ForestPlots.net web application was designed primarily as a repository
for long-term intact tropical forest inventory plots, where trees within
an area are individually identified, measured and tracked through time."
\end{quote}

Of the three sets of ground plot data, the data from \cite{rainfor} and
\cite{atdn} were already available in the \cite{forest-plots} database.

The plot data from the \cite{team} and \cite{ppbio} projects were downloaded
and imported into the \cite{forest-plots} database manually.

A permanent archive of the combined field plot data is stored
in the \cite{forest-plots} database as a publically available
dataset\footnote{\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.5521/FORESTPLOTS.NET/2014_1}}
and is available in the supporting information for the paper.

\subsubsection{\cite{term-agb} data}

The \cite{term-agb} data for the forest plots were calculated using a
\cite{comp-lang-sql} query provided by the \cite{forest-plots} system which
implements the tropical forest model described in \citetitle*{chave-2005}
(\cite{chave-2005}).
The results of the \cite{term-agb} calculation for each forest plot are
included in the combined field plot dataset stored in the \cite{forest-plots}
database.

The paper refers to a number of maps derived from the field plot data and
other sources which were generated as part of the analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{kriged} map of mean wood density ($\rho$).
    \item Ratio of diameter (D) to tree height (H) \cite{feldpausch-2012}.
    \item \cite{kriged} map of basal area.
    \item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D and species-specific
    $\rho$, and a regional height model (K\textsubscript{DH$\rho$}).
    \item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D and species-specific
    $\rho$, but a pan Amazonian height model (K\textsubscript{D$\rho$}).
    \item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D, regional height
    models and $\rho$, but with $\rho$ fixed at 0.63 (K\textsubscript{DH}).
    \item \cite{kriged} map of \cite{term-agb} using D, pan-Amazonian height
    model, and $\rho$ fixed at 0.63 (K\textsubscript{D}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{term-agb} map from \cite{saatchi-2011} (RS1).
    \item \cite{term-agb} map from \cite{baccini-2012} (RS2).
    \item Difference between RS1 and K\textsubscript{DH$\rho$}.
    \item Difference between RS2 and K\textsubscript{DH$\rho$}.
    \item Difference between RS1 and RS2.
\end{itemize}

These derived datasets and maps are not available in the supporting
information for the paper.

The \cite{term-agb} data derived from two remote-sensing-derived maps,
\cite{saatchi-2011} and \cite{baccini-2012} are not available in the
supporting information for the paper.

\section{\cite{tropo} Requirements}

Based on the tropical use cases we have studied so far it is clear that
data discovery forms a significant part of the requirements for \cite{tropo}.

\subsection{External Data}

In many of the use cases a significant part of the source material for
the use case has come from outside the \cite{tropo} network.

For example, both the \cite{saatchi-2011} and \cite{baccini-2012}
datasets used in the \cite{mitchard-2014} use case came from external
data sources, hosted at the lead author's organizations, i.e. the
\citetitle*{nasa-jpl-carbon} and \citetitle*{whrc} respectively.

In the short-term, in order to make this type of external data available
as part of the \cite{tropo} data discovery process, it will be necessary
for a member of the \cite{tropo} network to register and curate the
metadata describing the external data.

In the longer-term, the ideal solution would be to encourage authors such
as Saatchi and Baccini to join the \cite{tropo} network and participate in
developing the standards and \cite{web-service} interfaces for data sharing
and discovery.

Note that a number of cooperative international links of this kind have
already been established through the World Forest Observatory network.

Also, it is worth noting that a number of \cite{nasa} projects are active
members of the \cite{ivoa}, participating in the working groups and
conferences and contributing towards developing the \cite{ivoa} standards.

In order to promote this, it may be beneficial for \cite{atrop} members to
establish links with, and become members of,
existing international standardization efforts within the
relevant communities.
 
\subsection{Internal Data}

A number of the tropical use cases require access to data provided by
members of the \cite{tropo} network. Promoting and facilitating this kind
of data sharing and re-use of results within the \cite{tropo} network is
one of the key goals of the \cite{atrop} project.

In order to support this activity, the \cite{atrop} system needs to enable
individual members of the \cite{tropo} network to publish metadata describing
their datasets in the \cite{atrop} system.

Once these metadata are available within the \cite{atrop} system, it enables
other members of the \cite{tropo} network to discover and use the data as
source material for their own research.

\section{\cite{ivoa} Software}

In both cases, the requirements for the data discovery process are that the
users are able to specify an area of interest and the type of data they are
interested in and then gradually narrow the search criteria in response to
the data discovery results until they find the most suitable data
for their purposes.

Based on this outline we can begin to evaluate how well the \cite{ivoa}
and \cite{astro} software meets the \cite{atrop} requirements and compare
this with equivalent \citetitle*{gis} (\cite{gis}) software available.

At first glance, the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{atrop} data discovery processes
are very similar. Suggesting that the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software
should be a good fit for the \cite{atrop} requirements.

However, there are a number of issues that may mean that the \cite{ivoa} and
\cite{astro} software are not the best solution for meeting the \cite{atrop}
requirements.

\subsection{Data Models}

One issue is that a significant part of the \cite{ivoa} metadata structure
include a number of domain specific astronomy concepts and terms, making
it an imperfect match for a different domain.

It would be possible to remove the domain specific concepts and terms from
the \cite{ivoa} data model and replace them with something more suited to
the \cite{atrop} domain.
However, doing this piece at a time, gradually evolving a new metadata
data model for the \cite{atrop} project would be a non-trivial undertaking
involving a significant commitment of time and resources.
The \cite{ivoa} \cite{ivoa-obscore} data model that
forms the basis of the \cite{ivoa} data discovery process is the result
of 10 years' work by the \cite{ivoa} working groups to define a common data
model for astronomy observations.
It would be likely to take a similar length of time for the \cite{tropo}
network to develop an equivalent data model from scratch.

With this in mind, it may be more practical to base the \cite{atrop}
metadata on existing data models and data description techniques that are
already in use within the \cite{tropo} network or that has been developed
for domains closley related to to the \cite{tropo} network.

There are a number of such data models available. They include the
\citetitle*{format-world} and the \citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml}) metadata
formats.

\subsubsection{\citetitle*{format-world}}

The \citetitle*{format-world} format provides a simple way of annotating
an existing map or raster image with \cite{gis} location metadata.

The \cite{format-world} format consists of a plain text file format containing
details of the location, scale and rotation of a map or raster image.

Both of the \cite{saatchi-2011} and \cite{baccini-2012} remote sensing
datasets provide \cite{format-world} metadata using the \textit{example.tfw}
convention to associate the metadata with the \cite{format-geotiff} maps.

This is a simple example of an established convention within the \cite{gis}
community for linking \cite{gis} metadata to datasets or maps.

\subsubsection{\citetitle*{eml}}

\citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml}) is a detailed set of specifications for metadata
describing ecological datasets, based on work done by the Ecological
Society of America and associated efforts \citetitle*{michener-1997}
(\cite{michener-1997}).

These are just two examples of metadata data models and data description
techniques that are already in use within the \cite{gis} and ecology domains.

This highlights a significant opportunity for the \cite{tropo} network to
identify the existing metadata datamodels and data description techniques
already in use by members of the \cite{tropo} network and to work together
to define a common set of interoperable models and techniques that best
describe the data used by the \cite{tropo} network.

\subsection{Data Owners}

A second issue with the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} metadata \cite{ivoa-reg}
and data discovery tools concerns the allocation of roles and responsibilities
for managing the metadata within the \cite{ivoa-reg}, and the way these
reflect the structure of the \cite{ivoa} and the members involved in
developing the \cite{ivoa-reg}.

Historically, the most active contributors to the development of the
\cite{ivoa} standards and the \cite{astro} software have been primary data
providers within the international and UK astronomy communities.
Many of these represent large scale data providers responsible for
publishing and curating primary science archives for telescope surveys or
satellite missions.

In the \cite{tropo} domain these are equivalent to the upstream remote sensing
scientists who process the original satellite remote sensing data, such as the
\cite{landsat} data and publish the resulting forest area maps.

This has influenced the way that the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software
and services have been developed. In particular, the priority has been
to concentrate on providing tools and services for publishing the large
primary source datasets.

This emphasis on the larger data providers has meant that the curation of the
dataset metadata was seen as a system administrator role. As a result, many
of the current tools for managing and curating datasets are designed around a
single system administrator role managing the metadata for an entire service,
rather that individual researchers managing the metadata for their own data.

In contrast, in the \cite{atrop} use cases the hope is that a significant
portion of the data in the system will be provided by and curated by
individual researchers or small research groups.
For example, the results and supplementary data for the (\cite{mitchard-2014})
paper would be published and curated by the members of the research team
themselves.

As a result, the structure of the data models and access control systems
and the design of the user interfaces of the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro}
software and services would need significant work to adapt them to support the new use cases. 

\section{Alternative Software}

The issues identified with the \cite{ivoa} software would not prevent it
from being used as the basis for developing the \cite{atrop} system.

It would be possible to gradually replace the \cite{ivoa-obscore} data model
in the \cite{ivoa} software with a new data model designed for \cite{atrop},
and it would be possible to develop a new user interface and permission
infrastructure to enable individual users to publish and curate their
own data.

On the other hand, there are a significant number of existing software
applications and systems which have been specifically designed for handling
geographical and ecological data.

Many of these systems may be capable of providing an equivalent level
of functionality as the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} software and it
may be useful to look at a few examples to see how they compare.

\subsection{Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases}

The \citetitle*{givd} (\cite{givd}) system is a complex registry of metadata
describing databases of vegetation plot data from around the world.

The \cite{givd} system contains records for over 200 databases and 3 million
individual vegetation plots.

Three of the datasets used in our use cases are listed in the \cite{givd}
system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{[GIVD:00-00-001]}\footnote{\url{http://www.givd.info/ID/00-00-001}} \cite{forest-plots}.
    \item \texttt{[GIVD:SA-BR-001]}\footnote{\url{http://www.givd.info/ID/SA-BR-001}} \cite{ppbio}.
    \item \texttt{[GIVD:00-00-002]}\footnote{\url{http://www.givd.info/ID/00-00-002}} \cite{team}.
\end{itemize}

The \cite{givd} project team describe the system architecture and some plans
for the future to aggregate different types of data from external sources
(\cite{dengler-2011}).

\begin{quote}
``Our longer-term vision is to develop GIVD in ways similar to Metacat
(Jones et al. 2006), so that, ultimately, users who query GIVD will not
only receive information on which databases contain data suitable for the
intended analyses, but they will also discover other data from distributed
databases, with GIVD acting as the central node."
\end{quote}

This is broadly similar to the \cite{vo} architecture of distributed datasets
and to the \textit{`interconnected metadata collections approach'} described
in (\cite{jones-2006}).

However, the current emphasis is on providing a human interactive
search facility, with the \cite{givd} system acting as the central node.
The current plans do not include providing a machine readable interface
to enable the \cite{givd} system itself to be used as a component in a
larger distributed system.

\subsection{\cite{ppbio} Information System}

The \cite{ppbio} team describe the role of the data manager and the metadata
collection processes developed as part of the \cite{ppbio} Information System
(\cite{pezzini-2012}).

They also describe the transition from an initial flat file data storage
system, to a new system based on \cite{metacat}.

\begin{quote}
``To facilitate data searches, all the metadata were converted to XML, and
the PPBio has installed a METACAT server to integrate with the Knowledge
Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), a network which aims to assist ecological
and environmental research."
\end{quote}

This move towards open standards for both the metadata (\cite{eml}) and the
service interfaces (\cite{metacat}) enables the \cite{ppbio} Information
System to become part of a larger distributed system.

\subsection{\citetitle*{knb}}

The \citetitle*{knb} ({\cite{knb}}) is a network designed to:

\begin{quote}
    ``facilitate ecological and environmental research"
\end{quote}

by enabling researchers to:

\begin{quote}
    ``share, discover, access and interpret complex ecological data."
\end{quote}

The \cite{knb} system is based on a set of \cite{open-source} software and
standards developed and maintained as part of the \cite{knb} project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \cite{morpho} data management tools.
    \item The rDataONE R package for accessing \cite{data-one} repositories.
    \item The \cite{metacat} metadata database.
    \item The \citetitle*{eml} (\cite{eml}) metadata language.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\citetitle*{metacat}}

\cite{metacat} is a data management tool that provides a repository for
managing data and metadata in a single system:

\begin{quote}
``Metacat is a repository for data and metadata (documentation about data)
that helps scientists find, understand and effectively use data sets they
manage or that have been created by others."
\end{quote}

\cite{metacat} uses the \cite{eml} metadata data model and vocabulary to
describe datasets in the network.

In some cases the \cite{metacat} system stores both the metadata and actual
data itself, e.g.
\citetitle*{dietze-2004}\footnote{\url{https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/AA/mdietze.3.2}}.

In other cases the \cite{metacat} system only stores the metadata, referring
to data that is stored elsewhere.

This would be a good match for the \cite{tropo} requirements and use cases.

In some cases, the \cite{atrop} system needs to store both the data and the
metadata, e.g the results and supplementary data for (\cite{mitchard-2014}).

In this example, a member of the team working on (\cite{mitchard-2014})
would store the results and supplementary data in the \cite{atrop} system
together with the metadata describing their data.

In other cases, the \cite{atrop} system would only store the metadata,
along with a refence to the data stored in an external system, e.g. the
(\cite{saatchi-2011}) and (\cite{baccini-2012}) source material datasets
used by (\cite{mitchard-2014}).

In this example, a member of the team working on (\cite{mitchard-2014})
would enter the metadata details of the (\cite{saatchi-2011}) and
(\cite{baccini-2012}) datasets into the \cite{atrop} system, but the actual
datasets would remain with on the websites of the lead authors' organizations,
i.e. \citetitle*{nasa-jpl-carbon} and \citetitle*{whrc} respectively.

All three datasets would appear to be within the same (virtual)
system, enabling \cite{tropo} users to discover the (\cite{saatchi-2011})
and (\cite{baccini-2012}) remote sensing datasets alongside the results
and all of the supplementary data for the (\cite{mitchard-2014}) paper.

\subsection{\citetitle*{data-one}}

\cite{metacat} and the \cite{knb} project are part of the
\citetitle*{data-one} (\cite{data-one}) project.

The \cite{data-one} project is part of the \citetitle*{nsf} (\cite{nsf})
funded \citetitle*{data-net} (\cite{data-net}) programme to build an
infrastructire that provides open, persistent, robust, and secure access
to Earth observational data.
 
\begin{quote}
"The DataONE project is a collaboration among scientists, technologists,
librarians, and social scientists to build a robust, interoperable,
and sustainable system for preserving and accessing Earth observational
data at national and global scales. Supported by the U.S. National
Science Foundation, DataONE partners focus on technological, financial,
and organizational sustainability approaches to building a distributed
network of data repositories that are fully interoperable, even when those
repositories use divergent underlying software and support different data
and metadata content standards."
\end{quote}

The \cite{data-one} architecture is based on a set of top level
\textit{Coordinating Nodes} and individual \textit{Member Nodes} located
at each participating institute or organisation.

The top level \textit{Coordinating Nodes} provide a replicated cataloge of
the data in the \textit{Member Nodes}, enabling researchers to search for
and discover data across the whole network.

The individual \textit{Member Nodes} at each institute enable researchers
to publish data to the whole \cite{data-one} network.

This hierarchical structure is similar to the \cite{vo} architecture of a global
\cite{ivoa-reg} containing metadata describing datasets and services in the
\cite{vo} and the \textit{`interconnected metadata collections approach'}
described in \citetitle{jones-2006} (\cite{jones-2006}).

\subsection{\citetitle*{fgdc-geo}}

The \citetitle*{fgdc} (\cite{fgdc}) \citetitle*{fgdc-geo} is designed to :

\begin{quote}
``provide a suite of well-managed, highly available, and trusted geospatial 
data, services, and applications for use by Federal agencies-and their State,
local, Tribal, and regional partners."
\end{quote}

The \cite{fgdc-geo} system brings together metadata standards, software
and services that provide a set of features which are similar to those that
the \cite{atrop} aims to provide.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Map Viewer.
    \item Trusted Datasets.
    \item Multiple Basemaps.
    \item Collaborative Groups.
    \item Editable Layers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\citetitle*{ckan}}

A key component of the \citetitle*{fgdc-geo} system is the \citetitle*{ckan}
(\cite{ckan}) service, which provides the main metadata and data repository
for the system.

Development of \cite{ckan} \textit{data management system} (DMS) is managed
by the \citetitle*{okfn} network.

\cite{ckan} is used to power official data portals by national and local
governments in the UK, Brazil, the Netherlands, Austria, the US.

Examples of science based CKAN sites:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \citetitle*{bris} Research Data Repository\footnote{\url{http://data.bris.ac.uk/data/}}.
    \item \citetitle*{drdsi}\footnote{\url{http://drdsi.jrc.ec.europa.eu/}}.
    \item \citetitle*{netl} Energy Data eXchange\footnote{\url{https://edx.netl.doe.gov/about}}.
    \item \citetitle*{ngds} \footnote{\url{http://geothermaldata.org/}}.
    \item \citetitle*{noaa} data catalog\footnote{\url{https://data.noaa.gov/dataset}}.
\end{itemize}

As with the \cite{metacat} system, \cite{ckan} is able to store the data
along with the metadata describing it, or just store the metadata about
a data resource held in an external system.

This matches the two use cases described above, where members of a research
team would store their results and supplementary data in the \cite{atrop}
system together with the metadata describing the data, or they would enter
the metadata for an external dataset stored in remote repository.

As with the \cite{metacat} system, \cite{ckan} is designed to function
as a node in a federated network of services, using a metadata harvesting
mechanism to bring together metadata about resources in other nodes.

This model of using distributed federation of collaborating services
is similar to the \cite{ivoa} and \cite{astro} architecture and the
\textit{`interconnected metadata collections approach'} described in
\citetitle{jones-2006} (\cite{jones-2006}).

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Core Software}

Although the \cite{astro} software could in theory be modified to meet
the \cite{tropo} requirements, the results of this evaluation indicate
that the changes required would be non-trivial.

A number of factors contribute to this, including the differences
between the data models, use cases and data ownership, and the fact
that the service technologies and standards have evolved and user
expectations have changed since the core \cite{astro}
systems were developed.

Conversely, a number of systems already exist in domains adjacent to
\cite{atrop} which are based on similar ideas and provide broadly
similar functionality.

The \cite{metacat} and \cite{ckan} systems are two examples that make
use of the latest technical standards and technologies and are perhaps
better suited to handling the \cite{atrop} use cases and data models.

With this in mind, we recomend that future work on the \cite{atrop}
project looks at basing the \cite{atrop} system on the \cite{metacat}
or \cite{ckan} systems.

This enables us to build on the considerable geospatial functionality and
domain-specific knowledge that is already available within the developer
communities for these systems,
while at the same time taking full advantage of the key lessons and
knowledge gained from our involment in developing the \cite{astro} and
\cite{ivoa} \cite{vo} projects.

Both \cite{metacat} and \cite{ckan} already provide support for the \cite{gis}
and \cite{eml} metadata models. In addition, both projects are actively
involved in large scale cross disciplinary data management projects:
\cite{metacat} is part of the \cite{data-one} project, which is specifically
aimed at building the infrastructure for earth observational data; and
\cite{ckan} is used in a number of national \cite{data-gov} projects, in
particular the \cite{fgdc} \cite{fgdc-geo} system which is specifically
aimed at handling geospatial data.
    
A number of the \cite{atrop} science cases are based on remote sensing
data from sources such as \cite{landsat} and on processed data products
from groups such as those based at \cite{nasa-jpl-carbon} and \cite{whrc}.
Ideally, in the long term, the best way to support the tropical
science cases would be to encourage the external data providers to join
the \cite{tropo} network and adopt the same metadata and service standards.

Basing the \cite{atrop} system on software that is already being used by cross
disciplinary projects that handle earth observational and geospatial data
using the established \cite{gis} and \cite{eml} metadata models is likely
to make it easier encourage data providers such as \cite{nasa-jpl-carbon}
and \cite{whrc} to participate.

The best way to start this process is for the \cite{tropo} network to work
together to identify metadata datamodels and data description techniques
already in use and to work together to define a common set of interoperable
models and techniques that best describe the data used by the \cite{tropo}
network.

In addition, where the \cite{tropo} network relies on existing and established
standards, representative members of the \cite{atrop} community should join
the relevant external groups responsible for developing these standards.

\subsection{Project Structure}

The \cite{astro} project succeded in its goal of delivering a \cite{vo}
system for the UK astronomy community, and as one of the founding members
of the \cite{ivoa} played a significant part in establishing the \cite{ivoa}
structure and processes.

The fact that over 10 years since it was first established the the \cite{ivoa}
is still an active community of scientists and engineers busy working on
developing the next generation of services and specifications is due to the
organizational structures and processes put in place early in the
\cite{astro} and \cite{ivoa} projects.

We would recommend that the \cite{atrop} project adopts a similar
organizational structure and development processes.

An important lesson learned from the \cite{astro} and \cite{ivoa}
projects is that developing and agreeing common metadata and
interoperability standards is crucial to the successful operation
of a heterogenous, distributed data system, and that this process
must involve all the stake holders working together, including
the end user data-consumers and the primary source data-providers. 

The key component of this is building an active community and
encouraging the participants to work together to design and develop
their own set of use cases, standards and data models that meet the
community's requirements.
