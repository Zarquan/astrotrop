\section{Introduction}

\section{The IVOA Virtual Observatory}

The \citetitle*{ivoa} (\cite{ivoa}) was formed in June 2002 with a mission to
\begin{quote}
"facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory."
\end{quote}

The Virtual Observatory (VO) is the realization of the \cite{ivoa} vision of
an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The work of the IVOA focuses on the development of standards, providing a forum
for members to debate and agree the technical standards that are needed to make
the VO possible.

The operational VO itself is comprised of a global shared metadata registry,
the Registry, and a range of individual data discovery and data access services
deployed at each of the participating institutes.
These components work together to present a uniform mechanism for discovering
and accessing data, irrespective of where it is physically located.

The VO architecture and data discovery processes are very similar to the
interconnected metadata collections approach described in
\citetitle{jones-2006} (\cite{jones-2006}).

\begin{quote}
".... a more loosely structured collection of project-specific data sets
accompanied by structured metadata about each of the data sets."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"Each of the data sets is stored in a manner that is opaque to the data system in
that the data themselves cannot be directly queried; rather, the structured
metadata describing the data is queried in order to locate data sets of
interest.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
After data sets of interest are located, more detailed information
.... can be extracted from the metadata and used to load, query, and
manipulate individual data sets."
\end{quote}

\subsection{Example use case}

A useful way to illustrate how the data discovery process works in the VO
is to look at an example task such as selecting images covering a particular
region of the sky, in a particular wavelength e.g. infrared, visible light,
radio or xray.

\subsubsection{Service discovery}

The first step of the process is to identify the services that provide access to
the type of data we are looking for by querying the Registry.

The Registry is comprised of a number of small local registries, typically
hosted at the participating institute level, working in cooperation with a set
of higer level global registries typically hosted by a few key institutes that
aggregate the data from the smaller registries to create a global searchable
index of metadata describing all of the services and datasets available in
the VO.

When a new service is deployed, part of the deployment process involves
registering the service with the local registry. The local registry is then
responsible for collecting and storing the metadata that describes both the
service itself and the datasets that it provides access to.

Once the metadata for a serviceor dataset has been registered in a local registry,
it is automatically propagated up to the next level and replicated between the
global registries.

This makes it possible to access the metadata for all of the services and datasets
published in the VO by querying any one of the global registries.

The first step in fulfilling our example use case is to identify services that
contain the type of data we are looking for, in this case images, by querying
the registry for services that support the Simple Image Access (SIA)
%\endnote{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/SIA/}
capability.

In addition to the technical details of services and their capabilities the
registry metadata also contains details about the content of datasets, including
details of the wavelength(s) measured, e.g. infrared, visible, radio or xray.

This allows us to refine our query to search for SIA services that contain
images in a specific waveband, e.g. optical, infrared or x-ray.

The registry query would return a table of data, each row of which contains
information about a SIA service that provides the type of data we are
interested in - images in a particular wavelength.

The VO is itself an evolving system, building on the existing work to add
additional levels of integration as new features are added to the IVOA
specifications.

A recent addition to the IVOA is the HEALPix Multi-Order Coverage Map (MOC)
%\endnote{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/MOC/}
which will allow registry services to perform coarse grained region matches.

Once this is in place we should be able to further refine our query to filter
for SIA services that contained data in a particular region of the sky.

\subsubsection{Data discovery}

The next stage of the process is to query each of the SIA services in the list
to discover details about the individual images available from that service.

\noindent
A SIA query can specify parameters for a particular wavelength and a particular
region of the sky :
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{POS}  The positional region
  \item \texttt{BAND} The energy interval
\end{itemize}

Each SIA service would return a table of data, each row of which contains
metadata about an individual image. The details of the fields in the
image metadata are defined in the ObsCore
%\endnote{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ObsCore/}
data model.

As every one of the SIA services returns a standard response, it makes it easy
to combine them to produce a single list of all the images available in the VO
that match our search criteria.

The user can then select which data products they are interested in, and their
client software can use the metadata in the SIA results to access the individual
data products and display them in the appropriate tools.

\noindent
The two key components of this process are :
\begin{itemize}
  \item A standard interface for the global registry that uses a standard set of
  attributes to describe datasets and services
  \item A standard interface for local data access services that uses a standard
  set of attributes to describe the available data products
\end{itemize}

The separation between the initial service discovery query at the global
level followed by individual data discovery queries at the local level
are very similar to the stages described in (Jones et al. 2006) - of first
querying the metadata to establish the location of suitable data followed
by individual queries to establish what the data is and how to access it.

\section{Tropical forest science}

\subsection{Carbon density comparison}

We can compare the VO data discovery process for astronomy data with an example
use case based on a recent study 'Markedly divergent estimates of Amazon forest
carbon density from ground plots and satellites' (Mitchard et al. 2014)
%\endnote{doi:10.1111/geb.12168}
%\endnote{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12168/abstract}
comparing remote sensing data from satellites with ground plot data collected
in the field.

The study compares two sets of remote sensing data, from
the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(Saatchi et al., 2011)
%\endnote{doi:10.1073/pnas.1019576108}
%\endnote{http://www.pnas.org/content/108/24/9899}
and the Woods Hole Research Center
(Baccini et al., 2012)
%\endnote{doi:10.1038/nclimate1354}
%\endnote{http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n3/full/nclimate1354.html}
with four sets of ground plot data from
Red Amaz√≥nica de Inventarios Forestales (RAINFOR) (Malhi et al. 2002)
%\endnote{http://www.rainfor.org/}
the Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN) (ter Steege et al., 2003)
%\endnote{http://web.science.uu.nl/Amazon/ATDN/}
the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM)
%\endnote{http://www.teamnetwork.org/}
network and the
Brazilian Program for Biodiversity Research
(PPBio).
%\endnote{doi:10.7809/b-e.00083}
%\endnote{http://www.biodiversity-plants.de/biodivers_ecol/article_meta.php?DOI=10.7809/b-e.00083}

\subsubsection{Satellite data}




\subsubsection{Ground plot data}

In order to calculate a single above ground biomass (AGB) dataset,
the ground plot data were brought together in the ForestPlots.Net
(Lopez-Gonzalez et al. 2009, 2011)
%\endnote{http://www.forestplots.net/}
%\endnote{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01312.x/abstract}
%\endnote{doi:10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01312.x}
database.

ForestPlots.Net is a website and database designed to provide a repository for
long-term intact tropical forest inventory plots, where trees within an area are
individually identified, measured and tracked through time.

In addition to the raw measurements of tree diameter, the ForestPlots.Net database
stores a comprehensive set of metadata including taxonomic information about
the individual trees and detailed metadata about the plots.

Of the three sets of ground plot data, the data from RAINFOR and ATDN were
already available in the ForestPlots.Net database. The plot data from the TEAM
and PPBio projects were manually downloaded and imported into the
ForestPlots.Net database.

The principal AGB dataset was calculated using a tropical forest model described in Chave et al. (2005),
%\endnote{Tree allometry and improved estimation of carbon stocks and balance in tropical forests}
%\endnote{http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-005-0100-x}
%\endnote{doi:10.1007/s00442-005-0100-x}
using one of the built-in SQL queries provided by the ForestPlots.Net database
system.

The resulting data set was itself stored in the ForestPlots.Net database as
a new dataset available for download as part of the source material for the paper.

\subsection{Diverse metadata formats}

Within the set of datasets used by this use case, we can see a variety of
different database systems storing different types of metadata in a varierty of
different structures and formats.

\subsubsection{Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases}

The Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD)
%\endnote{http://www.givd.info/}
is a database of metadata describing databases of vegetation plot data
from around the world.

\noindent
ForestPlots.Net is described in the GIVD database
\texttt{[GIVD:00-00-001]}
%\endnote{http://www.givd.info/ID/00-00-001}
as is the PPBio information system
\texttt{[GIVD:SA-BR-001]}	
%\endnote{http://www.givd.info/ID/SA-BR-001}
and the data from the TEAM network
\texttt{[GIVD:00-00-002]}.
%\endnote{http://www.givd.info/ID/00-00-002}

Dengler et al. describe the GIVD project in a 2011 paper,
"The Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD): a new resource for vegetation science"
(Dengler et al. 2011)
%\endnote{doi:10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01265.x}
%\endnote{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01265.x/abstract}
and suggest some future applications, including the idea of combining
different types of data from different, distributed, databases.

\begin{quote}
"Our longer-term vision is to develop GIVD in ways similar to Metacat (Jones et
al. 2006), so that, ultimately, users who query GIVD will not only receive
information on which databases contain data suitable for the intended analyses,
but they will also discover other data from distributed databases, with GIVD
acting as the central node."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"By coupling species specific trait characteristics (e.g. mean plant height,
specific leaf area, growth form) found in trait databases, such as LEDA (Kleyer
et al. 2008) or TRY (http://www.trydb.org), with plot-based distribution
information on those species, GIVD could support further refinement of DGVMs."
\end{quote}

Which is similar to the distributed architectrure of data discovery and data
access services used by the virtual observatory.

\subsubsection{METACAT}

Different institutes have different emphasis and different
aproaches to handling the metadata associated with 
 
In a 2012 paper by Fl√°via Fonseca Pezzini et al. about the PPBio project 
(Pezzini et al. 2012)
"The Brazilian Program for Biodiversity Research (PPBio) Information System"
%\endnote{http://www.biodiversity-plants.de/biodivers_ecol/article_meta.php?DOI=10.7809/b-e.00083}
they describe the role of the data manager and the metadata
collection processes that are in place.

They also describe the transition from data storage in flat files,
which was sufficient for the first five years of the project,
to a new system based on Metacat.

\begin{quote}
To facilitate data searches, all the metadata were converted to XML,
and the PPBio has installed a METACAT server to integrate with the
Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), a network which aims to
assist ecological and environmental research.
\end{quote}

Metacat
%\endnote{http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/metacat}
%\endnote{https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/docs/intro.html}
is an open source data management tool that provides a repository for
managing both data and metadata in one system.

\begin{quote}
Metacat is a repository for data and metadata (documentation about data) that
helps scientists find, understand and effectively use data sets they manage or
that have been created by others.
\end{quote}

Metacat is capable of handling a variety of different metadata formats,
including Ecological Metadata Language (EML)
%\endnote{https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/index.html}
FGDC Biological Data Profile.
%\endnote{https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/biometadata}

\subsubsection{DataONE}

The Metacat project is itself part of the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE)
%\endnote{https://www.dataone.org/}
project, a collaboration spconsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation to build
an infrastructire from distributed webservices that provides open, persistent, robust,
and secure access to Earth observational data.
 
\begin{quote}
The DataONE project is a collaboration among scientists, technologists,
librarians, and social scientists to build a robust, interoperable, and
sustainable system for preserving and accessing Earth observational data at
national and global scales. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation,
DataONE partners focus on technological, financial, and organizational
sustainability approaches to building a distributed network of data repositories
that are fully interoperable, even when those repositories use divergent
underlying software and support different data and metadata content standards.
\end{quote}

The DataONE arcitecture is based on a set of top level 
\textit{Coordinating Nodes}
and
\textit{Member Nodes}
located at each participating institute or organisation

\textit{Coordinating Nodes}
provide a replicated catalog of Member Node holdings, enabling
scientists to discover data wherever they reside,
and data repositories to make their data and services available
to the international community.

The individual \textit{Member Nodes}
at each institute enable them to make their data available
to the rest of the DataONE network
via a standard webservice interface.

Again, this two layers of data discovery and data access
is similar the virtual observatory architecture.
