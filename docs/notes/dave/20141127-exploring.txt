    BIEN project

        The BIEN project at the US National Center for
        Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) represents a
        significant step forward in that it attempts to provide
        access in one public archive to all western hemisphere
        plant occurrence data and includes both single observa-
        tions and co-occurrences in plots (http://www.nceas.ucs-
        b.edu/projects/12290)
