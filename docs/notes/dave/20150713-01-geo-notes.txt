    # GeoServer - External Web Feature Server
    # http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/data/cascaded/wfs.html

    "GeoServer has the ability to load data from a remote Web Feature Server
    (WFS). This is useful if the remote WFS lacks certain functionality that
    GeoServer contains. For example, if the remote WFS is not also a Web
    Map Server (WMS), data from the WFS can be cascaded through GeoServer to
    utilize GeoServer’s WMS. If the remote WFS has a WMS but that WMS cannot
    output KML, data can be cascaded through GeoServer’s WMS to output KML."
