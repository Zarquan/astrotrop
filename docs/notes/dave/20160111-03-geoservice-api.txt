    # GeoService API - not totally open

    It looks like significant parts of the GFW Open data portal are based on an ArcGIS system.
    http://data.globalforestwatch.org/

    Many of the dataset pages display an 'Open in ArcGIS' quick link at the top.


    
    ArcGIS is a suite of GIS tools produced by Esri

        https://www.arcgis.com/
        http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS

    Many of the dataset pages include a link to a GeoService service to access the data in the API dropdown list.

    The GeoService REST API is developed and published by Esri
    http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/geoservices-rest-spec.pdf

    The GeoService REST API was proposed for adoptiona as an OGC approved standard.

    However, a number of concerns were raised by members of the community and the standard was not adopted.
