        To be useful for scientists, professionals involved with environmental management and public policy makers,
        a data set must be properly stored in an organized structure and always be accompanied by detailed explanations,
        including information on how they were collected, where, by whom and when - the so-called Primary Metadata.
        Thus, it ensures that this data set can be understood and used again by anyone, not necessarily by whom collected.
        Metadata is data about data that helps researchers to find, understand and use efficiently these data sets generated
        by them or other researchers.

        Aiming to provide a database on Amazon biodiversity for various sectors of society, PPBio follows the principle
        that every collection of information should be documented in the form of metadata associated with the corresponding
        set of validated data and made available on a website with free access.
        
        Political Data PPBio is available in Section Politics data .

        The metadata present in the Western Amazon Portal PPBio follow the standard EML
        (Ecological Metadata Language - http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/ , Fegraus et al., 2005),
        developed by the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity
        (KNB - http: //knb.ecoinformatics.org/index.jsp ),
        an international network that aims to integrate data from multiple collection sites, laboratories and researchers.
        They are arranged as follows: title and abstract, keywords, owner, contact, associated parts, research project,
        usage rights, geographical coverage, temporal coverage, taxonomic coverage, methods, information access, data files
        and information on the attribute table.
        The making of metadata must be made ​​through the Morpho software, available for free download on the KNB network site.
        The PPBio team developed a manual for use of Morpho, which can be downloaded here (last update May / 2012).
        Read the manual before starting your metadata.

        To facilitate data searches, all the meta-
        data were converted to XML, and the
        PPBio has installed a METACAT server
        (http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/metacat/) to integrate with the Knowledge
        Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), a
        network which aims to assist ecological
        and environmental research.

        Metacat is a repository for data and metadata (documentation about data) that helps scientists find,
        understand and effectively use data sets they manage or that have been created by others.
        Thousands of data sets are currently documented in a standardized way and stored in Metacat systems,
        providing the scientific community with a broad range of science data that–because the data are well
        and consistently described–can be easily searched, compared, merged, or used in other ways.

        Metacat is a Java servlet application that runs on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows platforms in conjunction
        with a database, such as PostgreSQL (or Oracle), and a Web server.

        The Metacat application stores data in an XML format using Ecological Metadata Language (EML) or other
        metadata standards such as ISO 19139 or the FGDC Biological Data Profile.

        The DataONE project is a collaboration among scientists, technologists, librarians, and social scientists
        to build a robust, interoperable, and sustainable system for preserving and accessing Earth observational
        data at national and global scales. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, DataONE partners
        focus on technological, financial, and organizational sustainability approaches to building a distributed
        network of data repositories that are fully interoperable, even when those repositories use divergent underlying
        software and support different data and metadata content standards.

        DataONE defines a common web-service service programming interface that allows the main software components
        of the DataONE system to seamlessly communicate.
