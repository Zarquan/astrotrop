    Environmental Data Discovery and Transformation

    http://cida.usgs.gov/enddat/UserGuide.jsp

        The Environmental Data Discovery and Transformation (EnDDaT) service is a tool
        used to discover data from a variety of data sources, collect and process the
        data, and perform basic transformations.

        The end result is that environmental data from multiple sources is sorted into
        a single table. This user guide will step through the process of obtaining data,
        and describe available transforms and processing available for the data.
