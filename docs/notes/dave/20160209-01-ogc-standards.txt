Hi Alan,

Regarding standards, this is a summary of what I have found so far.

I expect some form of these words will be in one or more of our presentations and reports.

If you want use this in your presentations then please do, it all helps to get the message across.

AstroGrid formed the basis of the UK contribution to the International Virtual Observatory (IVOA) project.

    http://ivoa.net/

The most significant and long lasting output from the AstroGrid project are the contributions made to the IVOA standards.

These standards are still in use today, over 13 years since they were first developed, enabling researchers and data providers to publish and share data in an international community.

The IVOA continues to develop and refine these standards, adapting them to meet changing requirements and advances in research methods, computing hardware and data volumes.

The OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) is the direct equivalent in your field.

    http://www.opengeospatial.org/

    "The OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) is an international not for profit organization committed to making quality open standards for the global geospatial community. These standards are made through a consensus process and are freely available for anyone to use to improve sharing of the world's geospatial data." -- OGC website

It is our recommendation that the AstroTROP and TROPGLOBE projects should endorse the OGC standards, and require their members to use OGC standards wherever possible.

    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards

In particular, the following standards are directly relevant to the AstroTROP and TROPGLOBE science use cases.

    Catalog Service for the Web
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalog_Service_for_the_Web

    Web Map Service (WMS)
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service

    Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service

    Web Coverage Service (WCS)
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Service

    Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS)
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Processing_Service

    Web Feature Service (WFS)
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service

Note that recommending the use of these standards does not necessarily require the development of new software or services. There is already a wide range of commercial and open source software applications and services that support the OGC standards.
