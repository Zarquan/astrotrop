    K.Tansey - in AstroTrop conference report

    "Planetary measurement has been facilitated by two recent developments. First, the
    free availability of data collected by Landsat and MODIS satellites. Second, the
    production by NASA of composite image datasets, initially in their Global Land
    Survey (GLS) composites of the highest quality images for 2000, 2005 and 2010 for
    the whole world (http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_GLS.php), and most recently in the
    pre-processed Web Enabled Land Data (WELD) series, produced initially for the
    continental USA only (http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php).Both datasets do,
    however, still require classification for mapping purposes."

    The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Long Term Archive (LTA) at the National Center
    for Earth Resource Observations and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, SD is one of
    the largest civilian remote sensing data archives.
    
    It contains a comprehensive record of the Earth's changing land surface.
    
    Scientists from around the world depend on this archive to conduct research on
    changes that affect our environment, resources, health, and safety.
    
    Time series images are a valuable resource for scientists, disaster managers,
    engineers, educators, and the general public. USGS EROS has archived, managed,
    and preserved land remote sensing data for more than 35 years and is a leader
    in preserving land remote sensing imagery.
    
    USGS EROS has a mandate to provide access and data preservation support for
    its land remote sensing data archive.

    Earth Explorer
    http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
    https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/earth_explorer

    The USGS EarthExplorer (EE) tool provides users the ability to query, search,
    and order satellite images, aerial photographs, and cartographic products from
    several sources.
    
    In addition to data from the Landsat missions and a variety of other data providers,
    EE now provides access to MODIS land data products from the NASA Terra and Aqua missions,
    and ASTER level-1B data products over the U.S. and Territories from the NASA ASTER mission.

    Registered users of EE have access to more features than guest users.


    GloVis
    https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/glovis

    The USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) is an online search and order tool for
    selected satellite data. The viewer allows access to all available browse images
    from the Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 4/5 TM, Landsat 1-5 MSS, EO-1 ALI, EO-1 Hyperion,
    MRLC, and Tri-Decadal data sets, as well as Aster TIR, Aster VNIR and MODIS browse
    images from the DAAC inventory.
    
    Through a graphic map display, the user can select any area of interest and immediately
    view all available browse images for the specified location.
    
    From the browse image viewer page, the user may either navigate to view adjacent scene
    locations or select a new area of interest. GloVis also offers additional features such
    as cloud cover limits, date limits, user-specified map layer displays, scene list
    maintenance, and access to metadata




    Web-enabled Landsat data (WELD) Projects
    http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php

    The WELD data products are processed so users do not need to apply the equations,
    spectral calibration coefficients, and solar information, needed to convert Landsat
    digital numbers to reflectance and brightness temperature.
    
    They are defined in the same coordinate system and align precisely, making them
    simple to use for multi-temporal applications.
    
    The products provide consistent data that can be used to derive higher-level land
    cover as well as geo-physical and biophysical products for assessment of surface
    dynamics and to study Earth system functioning. WELD data products are available
    to download for all users at no charge.
