    I have prepared a pres for the workshop on an application with the forestplots data as suggested.
    The pres is  here<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kmlliXi1GKh0A39JXr2s6q-7T2_KCSjR4MfvCsGQDUY/edit?usp=sharing> but I am struggling to see how this might interface with ASTROGRID software.
    I can provide the plot data and GIS files for one or two of the maps but am not sure how this will then work with the software.

    ARCASCII or GEOTIFF format grids representing properties of the Amazon basin at a pixel resolution of 1km

    ....

    Here is a smaller example (carb-stock.zip)

    I think at this stage just the one - as a demonstration.  You can use this one for the Amazon

    The CGIAR-CSI GeoPortal is able to provide SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Data
    for the entire world. The SRTM digital elevation data, produced by NASA
    originally, is a major breakthrough in digital mapping of the world, and
    provides a major advance in the accessibility of high quality elevation data
    for large portions of the tropics and other areas of the developing world.
    The SRTM digital elevation data provided on this site has been processed to
    fill data voids, and to facilitate it's ease of use by a wide group of
    potential users
    
    MIRROR DOWNLOAD SITE:
    Dr. Mark Mulligan (Kingâ€™s College London) mirrors the data, and has
    created a Google Earth Interface for browsing and downloading SRTM tiles.
    it also provides smaller (1 by 1 degree) tiles for users who have difficulty
    with the 5x5 degree tiles as well as 2D and 3D visualisation of the data.
