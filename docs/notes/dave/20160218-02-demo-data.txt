    I have prepared a pres for the workshop on an application with the forestplots data as suggested.
    The pres is  here<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kmlliXi1GKh0A39JXr2s6q-7T2_KCSjR4MfvCsGQDUY/edit?usp=sharing> but I am struggling to see how this might interface with ASTROGRID software.
    I can provide the plot data and GIS files for one or two of the maps but am not sure how this will then work with the software.

    ARCASCII or GEOTIFF format grids representing properties of the Amazon basin at a pixel resolution of 1km

    ....

    Here is a smaller example (carb-stock.zip)

    I think at this stage just the one - as a demonstration.  You can use this one for the Amazon
