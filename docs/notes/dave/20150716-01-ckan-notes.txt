    # Error - Geojson files to datastore.
    https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-dev/2015-April/008920.html

        Q
        I have installed a ckan instance and while the datastore works fine
        with other file formats, when I try to upload a geojson file I get
        a 409 error, even when I use geojson files from other working ckan
        instances from the web.

        A
        Its not possible to upload non-tabular data to the datastore. You may want to look at the MapStore

    # Detailed description of real-world harvesting
    # To Harvest and be Harvested â€“ Experiences with GovData.de-Harvesting
    http://open-data.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/ernten-und-geerntet-werden-erfahrungen-beim-govdata-de-harvesting/

        One of the main goals of the GovData.de prototype is to unite as many
        open data sets from Germany as possible in a single catalogue. Thspre
        biggest part is automatically imported by so-called harvesters. In
        this article we provide you with an overview on which tools have
        been used and how useful they have proven.

        ....

        In conclusion, it can be said that harvesting accounts for a key part
        of the work at GovData.de and clearly offers a corresponding added
        value. To grow continuously better in this area, a lot of small scale
        work is necessary. The cooperation between the providers and catalogue
        operators should ideally lead to a subsequent standardization of
        the metadata structure and the catalogue interfaces.

    # Data Catalog Interoperability Protocol
    http://spec.dataportals.org/

        With the emergence of Open Data initiatives around the world, the
        need to share metadata across different catalogs has became more
        evident. Sites like http://publicdata.eu aggregate datasets from
        different portals, and there has been a growing demand to provide
        a clear and standard interface to allow incorporating metadata into
        them automatically.

        There is growing consensus around DCAT being the right way forward,
        but an actual implementation is needed. In designing the following
        guidelines, the main requirement has been in all cases to keep
        it extremely simple, making as easy as possible for catalogs to
        implement them, both in terms of exposing its metadata and consuming
        metadata from other catalogs.

        DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability
        between data catalogs published on the Web.

        Open Data allows organizations to use the ArcGIS platform to provide
        the public with open access to their authoritative data. Organizations
        configure a website with their own look and feel and specify Open
        Data groups to share specific items. The general public can use
        Open Data sites to search by topic or location, download data in
        multiple formats, and view data on an interactive map and in a table.
