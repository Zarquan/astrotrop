HDF
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format

    "Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a set of file formats (HDF4, HDF5)
    designed to store and organize large amounts of numerical data."

NetCDF
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF

    "NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and self-describing,
    machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of
    array-oriented scientific data.

Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_and_Forecast_Metadata_Conventions

    "The CF conventions were introduced in 2003, after several years of development
    by a collaboration that included staff from U.S. and European climate and weather
    laboratories."

    "The conventions contained generalizations and extensions to the earlier
    Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service (COARDS) conventions and the
    Gregory/Drach/Tett (GDT) conventions."

    "The CF conventions have been adopted by a wide variety of national and international
    programs and activities in the Earth sciences."
    "For example, they were required for the climate model output data collected for
    Coupled model intercomparison projects, which are the basis of Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change assessment reports."


    "CF originated as a standard for data written in netCDF, but its structure is
    general and it has been adapted for use with other data formats."
    "For example, using the CF conventions with Hierarchical Data Format data has
    been explored."


Earth System Grid
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_System_Grid

    "The Earth System Grid (ESG) is a data distribution portal whose development is
    funded mainly by the United States Department of Energy.

    "It is the portal through which the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
    Intercomparison at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is distributing
    data for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the upcoming 2014 IPCC Fifth
    Assessment Report."
