            PRODES project carries out the monitoring by satellite of deforestation by shallow
            cut in the Amazon and produces, since 1988, the annual rates of deforestation in the
            region, which are used by the Brazilian government for the establishment of public
            policies. The annual rates are estimated from the increments of deforestation
            identified in each satellite image that covers the Amazon. The first presentation of
            the data is performed to December of each year, as estimated. The consolidated data
            is displayed in the first half of next year.

            PRODES uses satellite images from Landsat class (20 to 30 meter spatial resolution
            and revisit rate of 16 days) in a combination that seeks to minimize the problem of
            cloud cover and ensure interoperability criteria. TM images, Landsat-5 satellite of
            the US, have historically been the most used by the project, but the CCD images CBERS-2
            and CBERS-2B, the satellite Sino-Brazilian program for remote sensing, were quite used.
            PRODES also made ​​use of LISS-3 images, the ResourceSat-1 Indian satellite images and
            English satellite UK-DMC2. With these images, the minimum area mapped by PRODES is 6.25
            hectares.

        Proposals for Demonstration Projects

            "Partners described the information sets which they can share and these were matched
            with one another through discussion.

            Available Information Sets

                Leicester:
                    Mexico - Biomass map

                Bournemouth:
                    Mexico - Plot data
                    Mexico - Forest area change maps for > 60 forest types

                Bristol:
                    Global ecosystem models of leaf area index, photosynthesis, respiration,
                    carbon flux, biomass and burn area, run for 1950-2002 (with possible extensions to
                    1850 and 2015) for key biomes and 10 plant functional types with 50 km grid squares.

                Leeds:
                    Carbon change in forest plots in Amazonia, Africa + Southeast Asia.

                Sheffield:
                    Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau - carbon
                    Southeast Asia - carbon

                Edinburgh (Royal Botanical Garden):
                    Latin America - tree species in dry forest (point data and plot data)
                    Modelled biomes

                King's College, London:
                    Latin America - forest area change map (Terra-i)


        Presentations on Information Sets

            "Two of the information sets were the subjects of extended presentations.

                Leicester

                    Kevin Tansey outlined the various digital map information sets which he is analysing
                    or producing himself. They include three global forest carbon maps, from Saatchi et
                    al. (2011), Baccini et al. (2012), and Santoro et al. (2013); four forest biomass maps
                    for Mexico; and a beta version of a forest carbon map for the Congo Basin. By the
                    end of the year Leicester will have produced a biomass map of Mexico for 2010 as
                    part of the ESA GlobBiomass project. It was noted that there would also be a biomass
                    map of Indonesia as part of the same project.

                RAINFOR

                    Gabriela Lopez Gonzalez explained that RAINFOR started 20 years ago with 50 plots
                    in Latin America; this has now risen to about 2,000 plots. RAINFOR is a network of
                    friends working together and is expanding in scope to include dry forest data. Its
                    companion AfriTRON network covers forests in Africa, where lianes are especially
                    important. It has also initiated a global wood density database, called DRYAD.


        Mutually Agreed Sharing Possibilities

            "The following preliminary set of possibilities for sharing information in
            demonstration projects was assembled, together with the key science question:

            i. Amazonia carbon density (Leeds) - - Forest area change (King's)
            Q: Is there any relationship between areas of forest cleared and carbon density?

            ii. Mexico Biomass (Leicester) -- Forest area change (Bournemouth)
            Q: What is the rate of carbon emissions from deforestation in Mexico?

            iii. Amazonia Actual tree growth (Leeds) -- Tree species (Edinburgh)
            Q: Is tree growth species dependent?

            iv. Amazonia Actual tree growth (Leeds) -- Modelled tree growth (Bristol)

            v. Congo tree growth (Leicester) -- Modelled tree growth (Bristol)
            Q: Can measured tree growth validate modelled tree growth?

            vi. Mexico Dry forest species (Edinburgh) -- Tree Species (Bournemouth)
            Q: What is the coincidence between the two species databases?

                Santoro et al. (2013)

                Mexico - Biomass map
                four forest biomass maps for Mexico
                and a beta version of a forest carbon map for the Congo Basin

                By the end of the year Leicester will have produced a biomass map of Mexico for 2010 as part of the ESA GlobBiomass project.
                It was noted that there would also be a biomass map of Indonesia as part of the same project.
