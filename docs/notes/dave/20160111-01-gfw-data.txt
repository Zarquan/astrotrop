    # Email from Alan

    I have kicked off the year right from the start with a visit to 
    Washington DC to consult with key players here on the 
    methods they already use to disseminate global forest area
    data, what they think of our plan for the prototype forest 
    observatory, and their preferences for future international 
    standards.

    The two teams that currently map world forest area regularly
    using Landsat are both in DC, as is the World Resources 
    Institute, whose Global Forest Watch also hosts one of these
    team's datasets as well as its own. 

    The agreement of these teams is crucial if our other
    carbon and biodiversity partners are to have global 
    area data with which to combine their data.

    Reactions so far have been very positive and constructive.
