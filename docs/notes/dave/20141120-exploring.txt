    # The Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD): a new resource for vegetation science

        "Our longer-term vision is to develop GIVD in ways similar
        to Metacat (Jones et al. 2006), so that, ultimately, users
        who query GIVD will not only receive information on
        which databases contain data suitable for the intended
        analyses, but they will also discover other data from
        distributed databases, with GIVD acting as the central
        node"
