    JASMIN and CEMS Data Processing Environments 
    http://www.ceda.ac.uk/services/analysis-environments/

        JASMIN Services
        The JASMIN "super-data-cluster" is deployed on behalf of NCAS at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL).
        JASMIN supports the data analysis requirements of the UK and European climate and earth system modelling community.
        It consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage co-located with data analysis computing facilities, with satellite installations at Bristol, Leeds and Reading Universities. 

        CEMS
        On the JASMIN infrastructure, CEDA hosts the academic part of the Climate and Environmental Monitoring from Space (CEMS) Facility, a collaboration with the Space Applications Catapult.
        CEMS is a purpose-built facility offering space-based Climate Change and Earth Observation (EO) data and services.
        Its goal is to nurture growth in EO and climate-based services by providing, within a single facility, high performance computing, extensive data collections and various user services and software applications.
