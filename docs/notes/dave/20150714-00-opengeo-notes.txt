        "QGIS uses the GDAL library to read and write raster data formats,
        including ArcInfo Binary Grid, ArcInfo ASCII Grid, GeoTIFF, ERDAS
        IMAGINE, and many more."

        "If you aren’t familiar, GDAL stands for Geospatial Data Abstraction
        Library.  As noted on the GDAL website, GDAL is a translator library
        for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under
        an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source Geospatial
        Foundation. In total, GDAL enables support for over 140 different
        raster formats, and over 80 different vector formats with the help
        of its brother OGR (now part of GDAL)."
